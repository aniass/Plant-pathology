# Plant pathology classification


## General info
The project concerns recognition diseases on apple leaves based on their images by using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) algorithms. The analysis includes data analysis, data preparation and build model CNN with data augmentation to recognition of  leaves diseases.

The dataset comes from Kaggle competition (Plant Pathology 2020 - FGVC7) and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-pathology-2020-fgvc7/data).

This project is based on recruitment task.

## Motivation
The aim of thr project is recognition diseases of apple leaves. Based on apple leaf photos we have tried accurately assess its health. We have four types of categories corresponding to different leaves like  healthy, those which are infected with apple rust, apple scab and with more than one disease. In our analysis we have build model to distinguish between leaves which are healthy from those with diseases and we used Convolutional Neural Networks algorithm to get more accurate predictions. 

## Technologies

The project is created with:

- Python 3.8
- libraries: tensorflow, keras, pandas, numpy, seaborn, pillow.

**Running the project:**

To run this project use Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
